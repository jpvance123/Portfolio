<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

- Built web application to serve as portfolio showcase of all work done to date. Utilized Sanity query API to allow for smooth CI/CD and updating of completed projects. 
- React on front-end to serve responsive, clean UX design. Includes bio, Creative Portfolio, Skills & Experiences, Testimonials, and contact form.
- With Sanity CMS I can update projects without having to refactor code or logic.
